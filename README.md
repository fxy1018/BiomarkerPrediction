This is a data science project. In this project, lots of machine learning algorithm are used.

First, using API of NCBI to finish ETL of data. For data preprocessing, Meta-analysis, PCA, RMA normalization are applied to clean and format the data. 

Majority algorithms used here are Linear Regression, hierarchical clustering, support vector machine(SVM)
